1) About Polynomial Interpolation: -

Polynomial Interpolation is concerned with fitting a polynomial curve between the given data points. It is used for estimating values between the given data points. 

For eg: - if the data points given are (-1,1), (2,0), (3,5), (4,6) and (5,7), the polynomial curve would be: -
